====
* in session management, store user id instead of username
* on listing: link to create new ONLY if logged in
* on listin: pagination ONLY if there are more pages
* connect to external database
* blog post sub pages
* cashing of index page and sub pages
* check out google fast web app recommendations
* publish feature:
** when logged on, see all posts, unpublished posts have an extra button "publish", pubished posts have an extra button "unpublish"
** when not logged on, see only published posts
* fix that ignored crap, test whether date can be overwritten
* test what happens if non-existing id is called
* install blog somewhere in production, start to write posts



IDEA:
=====
## top level navigation structure ##
koeb.me/about
koeb.me/contact
koeb.me/blog
koeb.me/intern
  ++ blocked for robots through robots.txt, http base auth, login required
  * manage website (and those links as well)
  * manage blog posts
  * additional features:
  * * koeb.me/intern/notes (manage notes)
  * * koeb.me/intern/projects (manage projects: clients, time, invoices)
  ** calendar and addressbook ... ??

## additional requirements ##
* basic CMS system
** HTML snippets as elements in basic CMS
** tags to include those snippets in an html page
** include via ajax or statically?
* plugin system for notes, blog, and my project management stuff


TASKS:
======
## basic cms ##
* http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaTodoList
* install play, new app koeb.me
* CRUD for posts, a post contains of:
** a title
** a post text
** a optional teaser (short text)
** create date
** later: tags
** later: update tags?

* CRUD for pages, including 
** dynamic data-driven routing
** URL pattern (route)
** static autogenerated link-id for internal linking
** layout template ... ?? (needed?)
** subtemplates (?? ... needed?)
** which dynamic and static data-resources are used?
* add cache for parsed html pages and resources.
* controler to deliver page from cache or db or static, depending on dynamic route and page entry.
* plugin system

## refactor templates
* dynamic, data-driven with CRUD
* compiled and cached to be fast
* static content also compiled in
* method to recompile and refresh cache
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19556028/play-framework-2-1-3-function-that-will-render-scala-template-with-given-paramet

## refactor for JSON
* Content negotiation
* do not submit html, but simple json
* client side templating
* meteor??


## notes as plugin ##
* CRUD for notes
* tag to show notes

##  blog as plugin ##
* change notes so they can be published.

## timetracking as plugin ##
* later

## later addons ##
* a/b testing
* user metrics, clickstreams, etc
* block suspicious users/IPs according to defined patterns



FEATURES:
=========
* fast
* dynamic linking between pages
* no static files in filesystem
* horizontally scalable
* everything except code is data driven
* hooks for metrics
* task queue for decoupling
* collect Links (like synchronized bookmarks)
