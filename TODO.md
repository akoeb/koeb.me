=====
## top level navigation structure ##
koeb.me/about
koeb.me/contact
koeb.me/blog
koeb.me/intern

  * * koeb.me/intern/projects (manage projects: clients, time, invoices)
  ** calendar and addressbook ... ??

## additional requirements ##
* basic CMS system
** HTML snippets as elements in basic CMS
** tags to include those snippets in an html page
