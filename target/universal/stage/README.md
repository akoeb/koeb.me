## What's this ? ##

This is the repository for my upcoming website

## so? ##

Basically I wanted to experiment with a couple of technologies and figured, writing a blog for myself is a good project to work on.
Additionally, I plan to use the Blog to write about my experiences with those technologies.

Further down the roas I plan to integrate other functionality as well into the blog, but let's see.

## Which technologies are you talking about? ##

* Play framework
* Scala
* REST
* some experiments with whitty new javascript frameworks

So expect the code to change from time to time without any guarantee that it actually is working.

## Feedback ##
